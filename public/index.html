      Your
      bones don't
      break, mine do.
      That's clear.
      Your
      cells react to
      bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you
      and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown.
      However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</div>
